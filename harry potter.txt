In a few days, Harry will begin his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he can't wait. Ever since Hagrid, the giant, told him that he was a wizard and invited him to study magic, Harry's life has changed dramatically. He's learned that his parents, who died when he was just a baby, were powerful wizards themselves, and he's inherited their magical abilities. Now, as he sits in his small bedroom at the Dursleys' house, he's filled with excitement and anticipation for the adventures that lie ahead.

Harry's cousin Dudley, however, is less than thrilled about Harry's impending departure. Dudley is spoiled, selfish, and used to getting his own way, and he resents Harry for being different. But Harry doesn't let Dudley's jealousy dampen his spirits. He knows that Hogwarts will be his home, a place where he can finally belong and discover who he truly is.

As the days pass, Harry receives his acceptance letter to Hogwarts, along with a list of required supplies, including a wand, cauldron, and textbooks. With Hagrid's help, he purchases everything he needs from Diagon Alley, the hidden shopping district for wizards and witches. Each item is more magical and fascinating than the last, and Harry can hardly believe that he's about to embark on such an extraordinary journey.
